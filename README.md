# trivia-script

Thanks for checking out my trivia script

This is my first bash script and it took quite a bit of trial and error, however after getting it to work I felt confident in my ability to create input values, create a scoreboard, and create if-else statements.

I am currently halfway through a intro to python class, so I have a basic idea of Python aswell as HTML and CSS.

In this script I intended for the file to be named .exam.sh and it to be stored in ~/Pictures. I chose the pictures location because most people aren't going to be searching in the pictures folder. If you intend on changing the name of the file or storing it in a different location then be aware the script won't delete itself.

This was designed for a hackathon with a school theme. It pops up in the terminal and there's no way out of it. If you don't score high enough, we will have to walk over and input the password to get out. Doing this lets us see if they received a pass or fail message. Based off this they can possible get handcuffed and brought away from their team. However, there is no malicious intent behind this, this will be used as a time to learn how to pick handcuffs! It's pretty useful to learn ;)

I appreciate you giving my script a try and hopefully by the time you see this I'll have some other stuff for you to check out.
