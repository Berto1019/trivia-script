# trivia-script

Thanks for checking out my trivia script

This is my first bash script and it took quite a bit of trial and error, however after getting it to work I felt confident in my ability to create input values, create a scoreboard, and create if-else statements.

I am currently halfway through an intro to python class, so I have a basic idea of Python aswell as HTML and CSS.

This script also has the ability to delete itself after being ran. This was done so the user can't see the script if you don't want them to. If you do want to have the script remove itself then go to the last line and make sure to uncomment the command. Also make sure the path is correct, so just double check you have it saved in the same place (default is ~/Pictures) and has the same name (default is .exam.sh). You can change this information if you want, but just wanted to let you know what the defaults were incase you needed it.

This was designed for a hackathon with a school theme. It pops up in the terminal and there's no way out of it. If you don't score high enough, we will have to walk over and input the password to get out. Doing this lets us see if they received a pass or fail message. 

I appreciate you giving my script a try and hopefully by the time you see this I'll have some other stuff for you to check out.
